<h2>A Brave Child</h2>

 The family has raised it for two years. One day,
 when Luke walks his dog in the evening, the

 because he worries about the dog will be 
 caught by the bad guys. Then the next morning, 
 the dog goes home, what a surprise it is. </p>
 <h2>An Interesting Class</h2>
 <p>Today, I have an very interesting English class.
 The teacher teaches us the new lesson, after 
 explaining the new words, she asks us to make a 
 performance of the five situations. All of us are 
 so excited, we find the group and then rehearse for
 a while. When we play the roles, we enjoy the show, 
 it is such funny class.</p>
 <h2>Happy Mother¡¯s Day</h2>
 <p>My mother is the greatest mother in the world, 
 she takes care of all the family chores and she
 never complains. I know she it is not easy for her
 to do so, for she gives up her career when she has 
 me, so I am so thankful to her. On this mother¡¯s 
 day, I just want to show her my gratitude and 
 let her know that I love her so much. </p>

 so when I spend the time with him, we watch the 
 match together. The Summer Olympic Games is coming soon, 
 I feel so excited, my father will follow the games 
 and I will company him. It is a great time for both
 of us. We share our opinion and talk like friends. </p>
 
 <h2>My Future Goal</h2>
 <p>I will be a middle school student soon. when I 
 look back on my pass days, I find myself don¡¯t 
 make a difference, I play most of the time and don¡¯t 
 focus on my study. Now I make up my mind. In the 
 future days, I must study with all my heart and 
 learn as more as possible. So that I can store 
 something for the future. </p>
 <h2>The little Boy¡¯s Present</h2>
 <p>Jack is seven years old. He lives in an ordinary
 family, unlike other child, he is much mature 
 and knows to be grateful to his parents. Jack 
 always wants to give his mother a surprise, because
